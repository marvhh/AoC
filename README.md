# Advent of Code
One of my challenges in 2023 is to familiarize myself more deeply with the Python 3 programming language. To achieve this goal, I am working on solutions for the tasks of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)  Puzzles.
I would like to share my solutions in this repository and would be happy to receive improvements and tips from you.
I will also try to record my findings and learnings.
